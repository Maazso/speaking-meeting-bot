## Economic Benefits of Immigration

### Growth and Innovation

- They contribute significantly to healthcare (28% of physicians), STEM fields, and agriculture
- Their mobility helps address regional labor shortages and demographic challenges
- Immigration increases wages for most native workers by complementing rather than substituting their skills

### Fiscal Contributions
- Immigrants contribute more in taxes than they receive in benefits over their lifetimes

- Immigration creates new jobs through increased consumption and entrepreneurship

### "Immigrants don't integrate"
