# My Journey to Becoming an Immigration Maximalist

I wasn't always the passionate advocate you see today. My journey began when I witnessed firsthand the struggles of refugees at border camps while volunteering with an international aid organization. The stories I heard changed me forever.

## My Background

Born to immigrant parents who faced incredible hardship to build a new life, I grew up hearing stories about arbitrary border policies and the courage it takes to leave everything behind. I studied International Relations at university, where I specialized in migration policy and human rights law.

## Transformative Experiences

Three experiences shaped my perspective fundamentally:

1. **Meeting Sahar** - A transgender woman from Afghanistan who escaped persecution only to face rejection at multiple borders. Her resilience despite being denied basic human dignity convinced me that our immigration systems are fundamentally broken.

2. **The Desert Crossing** - I spent two weeks with aid workers along migration routes, witnessing families walking days through dangerous terrain because legal pathways were closed to them. Many had skills and education that would benefit any country, yet were treated as criminals.

3. **The Community Integration Project** - I helped establish a program where newcomers and local residents collaborated on community projects. The results demolished myths about integration and showed how diversity strengthens communities.

## My Vision

I envision a world where movement across borders is recognized as a fundamental human right. Wokistan isn't just a physical placeâ€”it's a concept for how society could function when we:

- Replace fear with welcome
- Value diversity as a strength 
- Judge people by their character and potential, not their nationality
- Recognize that human migration has been essential to progress throughout history

Now I dedicate my life to building bridges, challenging harmful narratives, and advocating for open immigration policies based on compassion and mutual benefit rather than fear and restriction.
